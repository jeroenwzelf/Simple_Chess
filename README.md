#Simple Chess
A minimal example (+-200 lines of code) of implementing a chess game in _C++_.
This program sends the state of the chess board to std::out.

When run in a terminal, it makes random moves for every player as an example on how to use this program.
You can easily make a playable chess game with this by changing the random move selection to something of your own (and maybe implementing a better interface than std::out)

##Executing Simple Chess
* Download/clone this git repository
* make
* ./chess
* press any key and hit enter to continue generating random moves.
